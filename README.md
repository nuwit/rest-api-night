# rest-api-night ðŸ¤©

Welcome! Tonight we'll be creating a random advice generator (fun animations included ðŸ˜‹) that uses the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/). 
Feel free to ask lots of questions and build on this project! Follow the steps below to get going:

## 1. Download a code editor (if you don't already have one).
A code editor will make it easier for you to look at and edit the code for your app. 

Here are some great **open source** code editor that is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux:
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: Microsoft's code editor with a super sleek user interface and terminal integration.  
- **[Sublime Text]: (https://www.sublimetext.com/)**
- **[Atom]: (https://atom.io/)**
There are lots of other code editors out there if you'd prefer something different, but Visual Studio Code is the code editor we'll be using during our demos. 

Got it all downloaded? Great!

## 2. Get the starter code 

### **Option 1:** Download the starter code.

Navigate to this repository again: https://github.com/nuwit/rest-api-night

Press this button and select **Download ZIP**

![Download button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/clone-repo-clone-url-button.png)

Make sure you save the folder somewhere you can remember! Then, use your file explorer to navigate to the saved zip. Unzip the folder. Feel free to delete the zip and keep the unzipped files.



### **Option 2:** Add template to your repo

Login to your github account (if you're not already)

Navigate to this repository again: https://github.com/nuwit/rest-api-night

Click this button

**If you'd like to test the starter code (and test your changes throughout) double click `index.html`. Refresh the page to view changes as you make them.**


## 3. Open the project in your code editor.

You'll see one file called `index.html` and folder called `js`. `index.html` is the file that constitutes the homepage of the website. The `js` folder is where all **Javascript** files will be kept. As of now, we only have one Javascript file, `main.js`, which is our main script for the website. There is also a **style.css** file that contains some minor styling for the webpage. Feel free to ignore it or play around with it!

## 4. Check out the Advice Slip API

[Click on this link to go to the API](http://api.adviceslip.com/) we will be using tonight. 

While there are hundreds of APIs to use on the internet, many are considered "consumption-only" and only allow you to make `GET` requests. In order to make `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` requests, many APIs require some kind of authentication. That will not be covered in this tutorial but we highly encourage you to explore such APIs like Twitter or Spotify's API!
Check out the **Random Advice** section of the API. The request we will be making is `GET` and the url is what will be making the request to get the data.
Now look at the **Slip Object** section. This tells us what fields make up the object that will be returned in the reponse. We will use these fields to access the advice string so we can display it. 


## 5. Go to `main.js` in the `js` folder

Now the fun part!! We will be making our request here. 

**IMPORTANT!!!** Delete lines 1 and 9-14

If you refresh your broswer and click on the button, it should have a blank pop up. We want to populate this modal with our advice data from the API. 
The first thing we want to do is create a constant variable with the request url from the API. 

At line 1 write: `const url = 'https://api.adviceslip.com/advice'`

This url will change depending on what information you're trying to get. For this project we want random advice but we could also get just one specific piece of advice. We would do this by calling `https://api.adviceslip.com/advice/{slip_id}` instead. 

Next, we want to make our request. We do this by calling `fetch(url)`. This method is part of *another* API, called [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). Fetch provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. 
`fetch()` provides a logical way to get resources asynchronously across the network. It's API inception!!

Inside the `getAdvice()` function after `confetti.start();` we want to write:
```
fetch(url) 
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(function(advice) {
            const adviceData = advice.slip.advice;
            document.getElementById('advice').innerHTML = adviceData;
        })
```
        

`response => response.json()` transforms the data into a JSON object and `function(advice)` handles displaying the data. We access the advice (string) of the JSON object by calling `advice.slip.advice`. This becomes text that we now can put inside our modal element, which we do by writing `document.getElementById('advice').innerHTML = adviceData;`

Finally refresh the page and watch the magic happen!
